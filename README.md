# iris-ml-project
This is my first in a series of machine learning and "data sciencey" projects in Python. This is a basic ML project which classifies the famed Iris flower into 3 species(target variable) with 4 categories(feature variable). This project uses ML tools such as Scikit-learn and additional modules such as TensorFlow, Adam and Matplotlib.
